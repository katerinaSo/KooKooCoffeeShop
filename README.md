# KooKooCoffeeShop
I was working on learning layout with css without using any framework. 
I found a wonderful course on udemy on css3 with teacher John Smilga.
To make my project more useful to the world I found a local coffee shop that does not have a website. 
I went there, took some pictures, talked to some people and decided to base my project on this real coffee shop.
The name of the cafe, location, interior pictures are real.
I will present the site to the cafe owner and see if there would be unterest to actually finish the site with real writing.
